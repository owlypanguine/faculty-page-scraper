# faculty-page-scraper
Prototype tool for the lazy (or efficient!) graduate school applicant. 

The existing code lets you do basic searching across faculty profiles at the University of Maryland's Department of Government and Politics website. It can be altered for use in other, similarly formatted websites.

**Input**: sub-field, search word/phrase, choice to filter out non-tenured faculty

**Output**: number of profiles including the word/phrase, the names of the professors, the links to their profiles, and links to their CVs and other documents where available

See sample output.
